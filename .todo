        Move files into a hierarchy.

        The test_xxx.cpp programs include "rfc2822/xxx.hpp", but
        the source code actually can't be built in place using
        those paths. There should probably be structure like
        this:

        | distdir / rfc2822 / ...    Header files
        |         / test / ...       Regression tests
        |         / build / ...      Jamfiles, Makefiles, etc.
        |         / doc / Doxyfile

        Prefer phoenix actors of pre-defined spirit actors.

        Dean Michael C. Berris pointed out  that Spirit 2.0 will
        no longer have pre-defined actors.
